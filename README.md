### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jordan Dufresne, i'm currently a student at ESGI (Ecole SupÃ©rieur du GÃ©nie Informatique) in the Software Architecture branch (3rd year)

I'm currently contracted inside Afnor GROUPE, in the PFNR team. We mostly do backend about french and foreign standards.

Feel free to look my projects, there is a mix of school and personnal project (most likely, python projects are personnal because we don't study this language at school).
Do not hesitate to contact me: [jdufresne3@myges.fr](jdufresne3@myges.fr)
